### Song by Hope Darst and The Belonging Co ‧ 2025
I pray into the atmosphere  
Spirit of God, You're here  
You have all authority  
I pray over my heart and mind  
I am healed by Your stripes  
Your blood declares that I am free

In the mighty name of Jesus, I pray  
Calling on the power of Heaven, I proclaim  
Every weapon formed against me, must break  
In the mighty name of Jesus

I draw a permanent boundary line  
The enemy has no rights to come near my family  
No scheme could ever undo God's plans  
No matter the circumstance  
The cross has sealed my destiny

In the mighty name of Jesus, I pray  
Calling on the power of Heaven, I proclaim  
Every weapon formed against me, must break  
In the mighty name of Jesus

In the mighty name of Jesus, I know  
All the power of fear and darkness, must go  
He's every key to every victory, I hold  
In the mighty name of Jesus

I will not fear, I will not fear  
When the enemy comes near  
On the door frame of my life  
Is the blood of Jesus Christ  
I will not fear, I will not fear  
There's an army of angels here  
I'm protected on all sides  
By the blood of Jesus Christ

I will not fear, I will not fear  
When the enemy comes near  
On the door frame of my life  
Is the name of Jesus Christ  
I will not fear, I will not fear  
There's an army of angels here  
I'm protected on all sides  
By the name of Jesus Christ

In the mighty name of Jesus, I pray  
Calling on the power of Heaven, I proclaim  
Every weapon formed against me, must break  
In the mighty name of Jesus

In the mighty name of Jesus, I know  
All the power of fear and darkness, must go  
He's every key to every victory, I hold  
In the mighty name of Jesus

It's in the mighty name of Jesus  
It's in the mighty name of Jesus  
It's in the mighty name of Jesus

Oh, the name of Jesus  
There's no higher name  
There's no greater name  
It holds all authority  
All powers  
It's in His name  
Oh, we're just beginnin' to lift up His name of Jesus in this place

We declare You have the power, You have the power  
Oh  
The name of Jesus  
There's no other name  
There's no other name

I will not fear, I will not fear  
When the enemy comes near  
On the door frame of my life  
Is the blood of Jesus Christ  
I will not fear, I will not fear  
There's an army of angels here  
I'm protected on all sides  
By the blood of Jesus Christ

I will not fear, I will not fear  
When the enemy comes near (oh)  
On the door frame of my life (my hole life)  
Is the blood of Jesus Christ (Is the blood of Jesus Christ)  
I will not fear, I will not fear  
There's an army of angels here (of angels here, oh)  
I'm protected on all sides (on all sides)  
By the blood of Jesus Christ (oh, by the blood of Jesus)

I will not fear, I will not fear  
When the enemy comes near  
On the door frame of my life  
Is the blood of Jesus Christ  
I will not fear, I will not fear  
There's an army of angels here  
Oh, I'm protected on all sides  
By the blood of Jesus Christ

In the mighty name of Jesus, I pray  
Calling on the power of Heaven, I proclaim (I proclaim)  
Every weapon formed against me, must break  
In the mighty name of Jesus

In the mighty name of Jesus, I know  
All the power of fear and darkness, must go  
He's every key to every victory, I hold  
In the mighty name of Jesus

It's in the mighty name of Jesus  
It's in the mighty name of Jesus (hey)
