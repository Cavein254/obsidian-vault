# worship
The new testament argues that worship is a continous activity. We are constantly worshiping. 
Therefore, the notion that we meet on Sunday's to worship is misleading and it should be more
of corporate edification. 
*Worship* - ascribing all worthy and honor to the creator as He is dutifully worthy.
Worship is not limited to Human beings. Other being as angels also worship (Rev 4).
Are we worshipping worship or are worshiping God?
