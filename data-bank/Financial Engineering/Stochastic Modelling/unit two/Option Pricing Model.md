# Empirical Performance of Alternative Option Pricing Model
There are various models used in option pricing. These models include:
- The Stochastic Interest rate option model (Merton 1973)
- The jump-diffusion/pure jump model (Bates 1991)
- The markovian model (Rubinstein 1994)
- The stochastic-volatility (Hull and White 1987)
- The stochastic-volatility and stochastic-interest-rates model (Amin and Ng 1993, Bailey and Stulz 1989)
- The stochastic-volatility jump-diffusion model (Bates 1996)
There are three assumptions each model has to make:
- The underlying assumption (the distribution assumption)
- The interest rate process
- The market price of factor risks
