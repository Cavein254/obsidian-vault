## Tasks
-  Tackling Group project two

## Notes
- *Target date funds* offer a way for individuals to manage investments as they approach retirement.
The funds strategy is simple, make the investment more conservative as the target day approaches. 
The strategy may involve investing in riskier stocks at the begining of a period and gradually 
rebalacing the portfolio to include bonds as the target day approaches.
A exaple is the Vangurd Target Retierement 2070 Fund. 
- *Strategic Assets Allocation* is an investment stategy where assets are allocated based on an individual
needs, period of investment, and investment objectives. For example one may allocate `90%` to stocks and
`10%` to bonds. After a period of time, they may adjust this porfolio as the prices of stocks and bonds
may have increased or decreased.
The main difference between TDF and SAA is that SAA does not worry about the short-term market horizon and 
implements a passive trading stategy. TDF is more active and takes advantage in changes in market opportunities.
